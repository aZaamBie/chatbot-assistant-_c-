This is a chatbot/virtual assistant named Jarvis (yes I know it's from Marvel's Iron man but it's a placeholder for now). It responds to the user when they greet, ask a basic question(e.g. what are you? ) . An amazing feature is that the user can type "search " followed by whatever they want to search, and the program automatically opens the default web browser and searches it.
